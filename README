Overview
============================================================

The increasing need to display data charts and graphs via the web
presents two major options in their generation: server-side, or
client/browser-side.  

The primary benefits of server-side chart generation is consistency
across browsers, and re-use of the chart image, e.g. in generated PDF
documents.  The primary benefit of client/browser-side chart
generation is possible interactivity, and generally more dynamic
behavior, e.g. immediately updated charts with a user's new input.

This app, django-webplotlib, provides server-side chart generation in
a convenient and modular fashion, relying on matplotlib for the actual
generation.
